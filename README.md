TunlrSwitcher
=============

A quick menubar application for Mac OS X 10.7+ that lets you quickly switch between the [Tunlr DNS servers](http://www.tunlr.net) (or any set of primary and secondary DNS servers) and default empty DNS settings on all adaptors.

Officially only supports 10.7+ but will run on 10.5, but I haven't done any testing below 10.7.

If the Tunlr servers change I will try and update this as quickly as possible. You can manually change the servers by clicking the TunlrSwitcher icon and choosing 'Preferences'.
