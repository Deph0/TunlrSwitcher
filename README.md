TunlrSwitcher
=============

A quick menubar application for Mac that lets you quickly switch between the [Tunlr DNS servers](http://www.tunlr.net) and default empty DNS settings on all adaptors.

If the Tunlr servers change I will try and update this as quickly as possible. You can manually change the servers by clicking the TunlrSwitcher icon and choosing 'Preferences'.
