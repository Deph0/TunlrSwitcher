TunlrSwitcher
=============

A quick menubar application for Mac OS X 10.6+ that lets you quickly switch between the [Tunlr DNS servers](http://www.tunlr.net) (or any set of primary and secondary DNS servers) and default empty DNS settings on all adaptors.

If the Tunlr servers change I will try and update this as quickly as possible. You can manually change the servers by clicking the TunlrSwitcher icon and choosing 'Preferences'.

Note that this is VERY easy to modify and redistribute for use with any similar service without even having to download the code. Simply go into the package contents and you'll find:

    Resources/tunlrOff.png - An 18x18 image for when the DNS setting is switched off
    Resources/tunlrOn.png - An 18x18 image for when the DNS setting is turned on
    TunlrLogo.icns - The application icon
    TunlrSwitcher/prefDefaults.plist - A plist file containing the default primary and secondary DNS servers
